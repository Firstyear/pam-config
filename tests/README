pam-config Testsuite
====================

1. Execute testcases
--------------------

To run all present testcases (all files with '.single' suffix)
simply type

  make check

and you'll get a summary which testcases succeeded or failed.


2. Add a new testcase
---------------------

To add a new testcase you might type

  support/new.sh -s mount-thinkfinger-mutex mount gdm

which adds a new 'servive' testcase named 'mount-thinkfinger-mutex'
concerning module 'mount' and service 'gdm'. This results in a file
named test-<name>.single in the "testcases/" directory.

Then you need to initialize its output by either:

  - manually supplying single.out/test-<name>.{err,out}

  - running

      support/init.sh testcases/test-<name>.single

    which does one test-run with your newly created testcase and
    stores "stdout" and "stderr" into single.out/test-<name>.{err,out}
    accordingly.
